## First Project – Raspberry Pi Thermal Test System

- For a company interview, I had to design a test system for a Raspberry Pi that would undergo thermal chamber testing.
- For this project, I created a slide deck presentation and tested the processor, memory, and audio capabilities of my own Raspberry Pi.
- The slide deck PDF for this project is called **`RaspPiTest.pdf`**
