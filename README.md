# Projects

Keeping track of projects and current work as of January 2026.

## First Project – Raspberry Pi Thermal Test System

- For a company interview, I had to design a test system for a Raspberry Pi that would undergo thermal chamber testing.
- For this project, I created a slide deck presentation and tested the processor, memory, and audio capabilities of my own Raspberry Pi.
- The slide deck PDF for this project is called **`RaspPiTest.pdf`**

## Second Project – Battery Management System

- So far, I have done a literature review on BMS systems and started taking an MIT courseware class on Power Electronics to be able to design a BMS with a 3.7V Battery
- Designed a differential voltage op-amp feedback circuit to regulate voltage
- Next Step, design current limiter for discharging Battery
